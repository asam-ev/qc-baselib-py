            This is the automatically generated documentation. 
            The lists of checkers and addressed rules were exported from the 
            information registered in the Result object for a particular run. 
            Therefore, some checkers and addressed rules might be missing if 
            they are not registered in that particular run. Double check with 
            the implementation before using this generated documentation.
